# Welcome to Something Blue
>let's plan a wedding together!

###### The Inspiration

Something Blue was inspired by my time working at David's Bridal as a bridal stylist. While helping brides find their dream wedding dresses, I witnessed the struggle that most brides face of feeling overwhelmed by the whole wedding planning process and how much there is to keep track of. To help users tackle the process, Something Blue provides all the appropriate tools in one place! 

###### Features 
<ins>Checklist</ins>
The main headache of any planning process is the never-ending list of things to do. This feature provides a pre-made list to every bride upon registration to help ease the stress of what needs to be done while also being completely customizable to fit the needs of every wedding! As things get done on the list, users can simply checkmark a box, see what date that task was completed, and clearly view a progress bar to ensure everything gets completed in a timely manner! 

<ins>Budgeter</ins>
Maybe the most upsetting part of planning any wedding, the Budgeter makes planning out a budget stress-free. Similar to the checklist, each bride is given a pre-made list of things commonly needed to budget for when planning while still being customizable. This feature also gives users a clear visual of how much of their total budget they have spent and how much is left! 

<ins>Guest List</ins>
The most straightforward feature, allowing the user to manage their guest list with important information, such as addresses and phone numbers. Also, keeps a running total of how many people invited to your wedding as well as a total of those who have accepted, to make planning for food and favors that much easier!

<ins>Vision Board</ins>
And finally, the feature to keep everything in one place, the Vision Board. Users can upload any pictures to this space that they want to refer back to as inspiration. Inspired by Pinterest but without the mess of home decor and future baby names, users can just focus this space on wedding stuff!
